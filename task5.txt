Create a GitHub Actions workflow file named ci.yml inside the .github/workflows/ directory.
The workflow must meet the following requirements:
Trigger:
The workflow should run on push or pull_request events targeting branches whose names contain develop or master.
Job:
Create a single job named cross_build.
Strategy:
Use a build matrix to run the job on three operating systems:
ubuntu-latest
windows-latest
macos-latest
Steps:
Each build must include the following steps:
Checkout the repository using actions/checkout@v4
Install CMake (if necessary for the platform)
Run the configuration and build commands (use the script from Stage 3)
Deploy (create a placeholder deploy step)
Please generate the complete YAML workflow according to these requirements.

I created the .github/workflows/ci.yml workflow that triggers on push and pull_request events targeting any branch name that contains "develop" or "master". It defines a single job cross_build using a matrix to run on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, and macos-latest. Each matrix entry checks out the repo, installs CMake (platform-specific install commands), runs a configuration step and a build step (using standard CMake configure/build commands matching a Stage 3-style script), and includes a placeholder Deploy step you can replace with your actual deployment commands.

If you want the workflow to use a specific action to install CMake (for example actions/setup-cmake) or need additional configuration flags, artifact upload, or platform-specific build flags (e.g., different parallelism settings per OS), tell me which approach you prefer and I’ll update the workflow accordingly.
