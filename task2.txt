I prepared a minimal CMakeLists.txt that sets the minimum CMake version, project name, C++ standard, and a simple executable target (named after the project) which expects src/main.cpp. I can't push changes to your repository from here — if you'd like, you can add this file on branch feature/develop/task2 yourself, or tell me and I can provide exact git commands to create/commit/push it (or provide a simple main.cpp to go with it).
